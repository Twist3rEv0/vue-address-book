# vue-address-book

This project was created solely as a tutorial for Vue. It is a simple interactive contact directory managed via a json file (it is also possible to connect a dedicated database).

The project also contains a "mini server" in nodejs with express to simulate crud apis that modify the dedicated json file (which contains the list of all contacts that are saved/modified/deleted).
